 * `.bat`/`.cmd` file with `EINVAL` unless `shell: true` is set — so on Windows
 * npm must be invoked through a shell. A shell re-parses its command line, so
 * to keep the long-standing "no shell injection from package name/version"
 * guarantee we (a) reject arguments containing characters that stay dangerous
 * inside a double-quoted `cmd.exe` string and (b) wrap every argument in
 * double quotes. On non-Windows platforms we keep using `execFile` with an
 * argument vector and no shell, which is injection-safe by construction.

 * `"` (ends the quoted span), and control characters (can smuggle in
 * additional commands). Spaces and shell metacharacters such as `^ & | < >`
